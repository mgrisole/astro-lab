# Astro-lab


Ideas:
- From the base planet Eleven, our astronauts are affected on different planets.
- Our astronauts can be:
  - On Eleven waiting for their spacecraft
  - On their way to their affected planet
  - On their affected planet
- The goal of this project is to build a dashboard allowing our ground control equip to monitor the global status of the Astro-lab mission.
